# React Server Side Rendering
A baseline for server side rendering for your React application plus Redux implementation.

## Getting started
Clone the repo with
```git clone https://github.com/vitomadio/React-SSR-Boilerplate```

Install dependencies with
```npm i```

Run dev mode with
```npm run dev```

Now open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and you get your server rendered React app. You can inspect the page source and see that the html coming from your local server has all the nodes defined in the React app.

## Take into consideration:
-Locate all pages inside pages folder.
-This boilerplate comes with react-helmet and has a Layout component set to share header or any other component through out all pages.
