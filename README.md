# Crypto-Currencies SVG Charts using React Server Side Rendering

This project uses Coinbase API for chart data, therefore you'll need to request a new Api credentials as for use it.
Also include Passport.js authentication alongside Postgres database.

## Getting started

Clone the repo with
`git clone https://github.com/vitomadio/Crypto-Charts`

Install dependencies with
`npm i`

Run dev mode with
`npm run dev`

Now open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and you get your server rendered React app. You can inspect the page source and see that the html coming from your local server has all the nodes defined in the React app.

## Take into consideration:

-Ask for Coinbase credentials.

-This boilerplate comes with react-helmet and has a Layout component set to share header or any other component through out all pages.
